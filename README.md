### Group 1: TitanTools
A group of miscellaneous utilities that I use all the time! 
The Save Backup utility is the best little tool I have made. It simply makes a copy of the active workbook and appends a timestamp to the file name.
The Range Info button provides information like Sum and Count which Excel already does...but this allows you to also copy the information.
A whole drop down menu dedicated to navigating your PC for special folder locations.
Another drop down menu for extra utilities that speed up those tasks you need to do now and then.

### Group 2: Trim and Clean Data
Dedicated to manipulating and cleaning your data you can also join and split text, add leading or trailing text to each cell and finally change case. 
When changing a sentence to Proper Case the following words will remain lower case if they are not the first word in the sentence:
- a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, from, if, in, is,
- nor, of, off, on, or, so, the, till, to, up, yet

### Group 3: Sheet Tools
Delete all empty sheets in the active workbook, unhide even sheets very hidden with VBA.
An awesome tool is to create sheet names en masse using the selected cell names

### Group 4: Export Data
Choose from a variety of ways to export your data, whether whole sheets to a new workbook or the selected range to CSV or TXT formats.

### Group 5: Table Tools
A collection of useful tools to export the data in your tables at each unique value in the selected columns. Each value can be exported to a new sheet in the same or new workbook or create a new file from each value.
A quick sort button for when you need to index or get the original order of the table. 
A custom filter button will insert a column to the far right, placing an 'x' in each visible cell. Then rename the Column header to something meaningful.
